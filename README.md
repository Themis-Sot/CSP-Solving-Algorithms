# CSP-Solving-Algorithms
Solving weighted CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) using back-tracking and back-jumping algorithms.

More specifically procedures used are, 

Algorithms:
- MAC (Maintaining Arc Consistency)
- FC (Forward Checking)
- FC-CBJ (combination of FC and Conflict-directed Back Jumping) 

Heuristic for Variable Selection:
- DOM_WDEG

Heuristic for Value Selection:
- LCV
